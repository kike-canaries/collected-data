# collected-data
Images, Data from public services that can be used to get things done,
Github is a third party that could be used as a means to validation in
time.

For instance if you grab a screenshot of a website and put this in a
public repo, there is a validation that your data is published the date
it was.

If you want to have your images hosted here, open a pull request, we
can host here country and city, the layout of the repo is:

```
├── country_code
│   └── city_code
│       └── project_name
│           ├── images
│           ├── README.md
│           └── scripts
.
.

```

Where

* country_code is the [ISO 3166 1 alpha 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements)
* city_code is the [IATA Code](https://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/code-search.aspx), if your place does not have a nearby airport, you can consider using [W3W](https://what3words.com)
* project_name in a way that describes what this is about
* README.md please put that in the language your audience is more akin to read
